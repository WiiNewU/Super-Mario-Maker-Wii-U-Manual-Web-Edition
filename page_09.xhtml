Once you have a complete course to play through, you'll often notice all kinds of little things you missed while building it. This is because while you're concentrating on perfecting one part of the course, it can be hard to take in the bigger picture. Especially with longer courses, remember to play through the whole thing once in a while to get a feel for how it all fits together!</span><!-- textbox_id-13 150622: No change - TM -->

            <p><span data-msgid="textbox_id-19">Whether you come up with it before you even start building, decide on it partway through, or leave it until the very end, it's important to give your course a good name. Legend has it that naming a course makes it come to life! ...OK, maybe that's pushing it, but still—it does give your course a sense of identity. Remember, the course name is the first thing a player will see when they encounter your course, so make sure it will get them wondering what might be in store!<br />What's more, the name you came up with can actually help to inspire you as well. Say you called your course "Mountain Madness" but upon playing it realize it doesn't feel all that "mad." Doesn't that just give you the urge to throw in a few extra twists to make the course live up to its name?</span>

          <p><span data-msgid="textbox_id-23">When you play other makers' courses, don't just leave comments like "It was fun!" or "It was awful." Try to be a little more specific, saying things like "I loved the way this platform moved around!" or "That part with the Spiny was so cramped, it drove me crazy." Identifying which parts of a course you liked and which parts you disliked isn't just helpful for the course's maker—it can help you to improve as well!

    <div class="column-txt">
      <span data-msgid="textbox_id-41">Remember, when a player tries your course for the first time, they have no idea what to expect. That's why they'll make mistakes and lose lives. But as they keep playing, they'll learn more about how the course works and they'll start to do better. The best Mario courses are those that make this learning experience as smooth and as satisfying as possible.<br />When playing a course you've created, you know everything in advance—the right way through the maze, where to find all the power-ups, where the next enemy is going to pop up—so you can dash through at top speed, doing only what needs to be done. You know exactly the route you wanted the player to take, so you can follow that route and make it look easy. And because it feels so easy, you might be tempted to make each step trickier to pull off, to give yourself a little more challenge.<br />But players facing your course for the first time won't have any of that knowledge. They'll get lost, miss mushrooms they should have grabbed, bump into enemies, and maybe even run out of time. If you're not careful, they'll get so frustrated that they'll give up before they ever reach the goal or discover that one satisfying route you wanted them to master.<br />That's why it's important to think about how a course is going to look to that first-time player who has no idea what to expect. You might want to give them room to learn and make mistakes without being too harshly punished, or you might want to carefully tweak your course to make it clearer which is the right way to proceed. The more you polish the experience, the more players will be able to enjoy your creation!</span><!-- textbox_id-41 150604: No change - TM -->

      </h5>
    </div>
    <div class="column-txt"><span data-msgid="textbox_id-43">Say you've set up a clever mechanism in a course for the player to discover, but the player walks right past it without even paying attention. Why? Because the simple path seems easier, of course! Or perhaps you see a player who spends ages aimlessly jumping around in one section instead of heading for the goal. Why? Because they thought there might be a hidden secret to find!<br />The thing about players is, they never seem to approach your courses quite how you expect them to. They're going to play the game how they want to play it, whether that's how you designed it or not!<br />So what's the solution to this problem? One possibility is to make the intended route as obvious as possible, or you could block off all unintended paths so that your way is the only possible way to proceed. For tricky puzzles that the player is unlikely to figure out without some effort, this can be the best approach. But in other cases, you might want to take the opposite approach, keeping the course open and giving the player the freedom to tackle it in a variety of ways. After all, being able to jump about freely is one of the most appealing elements of the Mario series, and there's a lot of fun to be had in searching around for hidden secrets. Carefully balancing that freedom to explore with more-focused challenges to overcome is the basic philosophy of a standard Mario course.<br />At the end of the day, Super Mario Maker gives you the tools to create almost any kind of course you put your mind to—but it's always more satisfying when you hit on a design that lots of people can have fun with!</span>

These types of courses are completely down to the individual creator's whims, and we can't begin to explain them here.<br />Just as some people are better at drawing beautiful pictures and others are better at telling funny stories, there's no single right or wrong way to go about making a course.
