You can create effects like this quite easily by placing a few Fire Bars and then adjusting their angles slightly. If you're not careful, though, they'll turn into an almost insurmountable obstacle for poor Mario! The tricky part is placing them in an arrangement that seems terrifying, but actually isn't so difficult for the player to slip through as long as they watch carefully. It can be incredibly satisfying when you make it through to the other side!</span>

How about we let people play as them?!" The first one we tried out was the Wii Fit Trainer, and when we saw it in motion, we all loved it.</span>

        <span data-msgid="textbox_id-122">In fact, everyone we showed this to was really enthusiastic, so we were all like, "Let's keep making them! Do you think we could make 30 or so?"
